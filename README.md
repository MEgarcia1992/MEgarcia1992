:boom: :boom: :boom: Hey you, yes You give me those 5 ðŸ‘‹. 

My name is Miguel Eduardo GarcÃ­a LÃ³pez :raising_hand:

Bilingual QA Engineer with 4 years of experience in the area of quality for manufacturing with the determined intention of applying my experience and knowledge to the development of software and IT projects and products in general. My focus on quality has allowed me to apply standards and techniques that have helped create daily yields above 98% of compliant products. I have a solid understanding of quality control principles in both manual (test cases, API, Postman, Jira, SQL) and automated (Python, Selenium Webdriver) software development.

As you can see my last years have been sorrounded by Quality so, I consider myself a person who likes things well done. I have in my back 4 years working as a Quality Engineer for manufacturing Industry :hammer::wrench: and according to my passion for knowledge, IÂ´m aware that new Technologies :satellite::computer: need Quality so IÂ´am 100%:battery: sure it is time to upgrade my career toward IT :computer: to be in the very current time and provide my expertise to those companies that need it.

Additionally, I want to tell you that I am human. I like reading, I also like to study and I think it is one of my passions so you will see me constantly studying something new:school_satchel::school_satchel::school_satchel::book::book::book:. I speak English:uk: and Spanish:es: to get by in daily and professional life but I have also learned a little about other languages â€‹â€‹such as Portuguese, French:fr: and German:de:.

I am always open to new opportunities and connections:v::v:. Do not hesitate to contact me if both parties can provide value.:punch:
